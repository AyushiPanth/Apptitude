# Apptitude

Hey, good to see that you want to look at my app.
I named this app Apptitude because I made it in 1 day for the hackathon Apptitude by ACM VIT.
So, in the hackathon I was given the task to implement three functionalities in my app. Those three were :
1.  Implement Search View
2.  Stream Videos from URL without external APIs
3.  Create a Drawing App

Being a beginner in Flutter, this was exciting as well as challenging for me. Although there are some issues in the app, I'm happy that I learnt a lot of things and was at least able to implement all three of the statements.
Let's see how the app works.
First screen is the main screen. It has the three buttons that leads to the three functionalities.

If you click on Search, you will be directed to Search View, here you can search for a word. Its a simple SearchView.

If you click on Video, you are able to play a video, it has the functionality of viewing th video in rotation mode and also you can alter the speed of video.

If you click on Drawing, you will be redirected to the Drawing screen. Here you can draw, choose a color, and even alter the stroke of the pen.

Challenges :
Due to less time, I was not able to input the URL from the user for the video. I was originally planning for making a Form so that user can input the URL and on pressing the button ze can stream the video either live or already posted one. 
I tried to include the dictionary so that on clicking on a word in Search, you can actually see its meaning, but i was not able to implement it. I will search more about it and try to further improve the application.
